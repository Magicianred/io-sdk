It may work on other configurations but it is not tested.

You need to:

- Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and give at leas 4GB of memory

Before doing anything, you have to [setup your environment](./../../../DEVEL.md#First-setup-of-the-development-environment).
